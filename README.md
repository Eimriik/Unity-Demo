# Unity-Demo
A Unity 3D project demonstrating my Unity experience and knowledge.

# Intent
This repository is intended to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency of Git, Git-LFS and development within Unity 3D.
Presently, the project isn't much to look at. It does however demonstrate the following:
- Scene hierarchy organisation.
- Asset folder hierarchy and organisation.
- Code Style and formatting.
- Understanding of advanced programming concepts.
- Documentation practices.
- Development of clean and clear API code (extension of Zenject/Extenject by defining and implementing modules).
